You will need git installed before anything so make sure you install git first and can call it from the command line.

Replace `<username>` with your username.
For example, if my username is rroig, than an example command would be `cd /home/rroig/.config/`

# Linux
To put this on your linux machine:
  1. `cd /home/<username>/.config/`
  2. `git clone https://github.com/rroig7/nvim`
  3. Done!

# Windows
To put this on your windows machine:
  1. `cd C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\`
  2. `git clone https://github.com/rroig7/nvim`
  3. Done!

After the installation steps, you should just be able to run nvim in the terminal, and Lazy should take care of the rest from there.

Note: To use live_grep, you will need to download ripgrep.

Note 2: You will need to create a PAT token inorder to clone the repo since it is private. Google that shit I don't feel like explaining it rn.
